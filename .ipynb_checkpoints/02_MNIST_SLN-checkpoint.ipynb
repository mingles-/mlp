    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to the first coursework about multi-layer networks (also known as Multi-Layer Perceptrons - MLPs - or Deep Neural Networks - DNNs). Here, we will show how to build a single layer linear model (similar to the one from the previous lab) for MNIST digit classification using the provided code-base. \n",
    "\n",
    "The principal purpose of this introduction is to get you familiar with how to connect the code blocks (and what operations each of them implements) in order to set up an experiment that includes 1) building the model structure 2) optimising the model's parameters (weights) and 3) evaluating the model on test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## For those affected by notebook kernel issues\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are still having issues with running notebook kernels, have a look at [this note](https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/kernel_issue_fix.md) on the GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you proceed onwards, remember to activate your virtual environment:\n",
    "   * If you were in last week's Tuesday or Wednesday group type `activate_mlp` or `source ~/mlpractical/venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "   * If you were in the Monday group:\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **comfy** way type: `workon mlpractical`\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **generic** way, `source` your virutal environment using `source` and specyfing the path to the activate script (you need to localise it yourself, there were not any general recommendations w.r.t dir structure and people have installed it in different places, usually somewhere in the home directories. If you cannot easily find it by yourself, use something like: `find . -iname activate` ):\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syncing the git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a> for more details. But in short, we recommend to create a separate branch for the coursework, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter the mlpractical directory `cd ~/mlpractical/repo-mlp`\n",
    "2. List the branches and check which is currently active by typing: `git checkout`\n",
    "3. If you are not in `master` branch, switch to it by typing: \n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    " ```\n",
    "4. Then update the repository (note, assuming master does not have any conflicts), if there are some, have a look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. And now, create the new branch & swith to it by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout -b coursework1\n",
    "```"

    "# Multi Layer Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we shall build models which can have an arbitrary number of hidden layers.  Please have a look at the  diagram below, and the corresponding computations (which have an *exact* matrix form as expected by numpy, and row-wise orientation; note that $\\circ$ denotes an element-wise product). In the diagram, we briefly describe how each comptation relates to the code we have provided.\n",

    "1. Structuring the model\n",
    "   * The model (for now) is allowed to have a sequence of layers, mapping inputs $\\mathbf{x}$ to outputs $\\mathbf{y}$. \n",
    "   * This operation is implemented as a special type of a layer in `mlp.layers.MLP` class. It keeps a sequence of other layers (of various typyes like Linear, Sigmoid, Softmax, etc.) as well as the internal state of a model for a mini-batch, that is, the intermediate data produced in *forward* and *backward* passes.\n",
    "2. Forward computation\n",
    "    * `mlp.layers.MLP` provides an `fprop()` method that iterates over defined layers propagates $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\mathbf{y}$. \n",
    "    * Each layer (look at `mlp.layers.Linear` attached below) also implements an `fprop()` method, which performs an atomic, for the given layer, operation. Most often, for the $i$-th layer, we want to obtain a linear transform $\\mathbf a^i$ of the inputs, and apply some non-linear transfer function $f^i(\\mathbf a^i)$ to produce the output $\\mathbf h^i$. Note, in general each layer may implement different activation functions $f^i()$, however for now we will use only `sigmoid` and `softmax`\n",
    "3. Backward computation\n",
    "   * Similarly, `mlp.layers.MLP` also implements a `bprop()` function, to back-propagate the errors from the top to the bottom layer. This class also keeps the back-propagated statistics ($\\delta$) to be used later when computing the gradients with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "   * This functionality is also re-implemented by particular layers (again, have a look at the `bprop` function of `mlp.layers.Linear`). `bprop()`  returns both $\\delta$ (needed to update the parameters) but also back-progapates the gradient down to the inputs. Also note, that depending on whether the layer is the top or not (i.e. if it deals directly with the cost function or not) some simplifications may apply ( as with cross-entropy and softmax). That's why when implementing a new type of layer that may be used as an output layer one also need to specify the implementation of `bprop_cost()`.\n",
    "4. Learning the model\n",
    "   * The actual evaluation of the cost as well as the *forward* and *backward* passes may be found in the `train_epoch()` method of `mlp.optimisers.SGDOptimiser`\n",
    "   * This function also calls the `pgrads()` method on each layer, that given activations and deltas, returns the list of the gradients of the cost with respect to the model parameters, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{E}}}{\\partial{\\mathbf{W^i}}}$ and  $\\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{E}}}{\\partial{\\mathbf{b}^i}}$ at the above diagram (look at an example implementation in `mlp.layers.Linear`)"
